				              <p>Mindfulness is the art of present moment awareness. It is about deliberately paying attention to the reality of our moment-by-moment experience; experiencing life directly, as it unfolds. Our over-active minds, unlike our bodies, are rarely in the present moment. More often than not, we are consumed by the past or worrying about the future - both major energy zappers. Mindfulness trains our minds to be calm, focused and still. But far from dulling our senses or emptying us of thoughts, it actually wakes us up!  We stop wasting our lives away on automatic pilot, eventually gaining mastery over habitual patterns of thinking and behaviour that are holding us back. As we allow our mind to rest in its natural state, we free up valuable brain energy, creating space for new ideas.</p> 
				
				<p>When we bring full conscious awareness to all the subtle sensations of our bodies and minds, amazing changes begin to take place within us. We learn that we can’t change our external world, but we can transform our relationship to it. We begin to appreciate more - reconnecting deeply to the beauty, joy and wonder of life.</p> 
				
				<p>Mindfulness gives us more time and space in our lives for the people and things that matter most. It is a beautifully simple, yet profoundly powerful way of being. </p>

				  <dd>
				
				              <div>
				        <p>Mindfulness is for anyone and everyone who wants to get the most out of life. It is now practiced by all kinds of people, from top executives at Apple and Google to Olympic athletes, artists, the US Marine Corps and even members of our UK Parliament! <br>
				<br>
				Mindfulness is described in many different ways nowadays – anything from a performance enhancer, a form of brain training or stress management tool, to an ancient spiritual practice. In truth, it is all these things and more. Though its origins lie in ancient eastern traditions, it began to attract the interest of western scientists over 40 years ago, and the practice has now been adapted to suit our modern secular lifestyles.<br>
				<br>
				Not only is Mindfulness an incredible life skill, it is also a profoundly personal experience that means many different things to different people. So whether you want the practice to help you be a better leader - to improve the quality of your relationships - or to guide you on the path to spiritual enlightenment, you find the entry point that works for you. It really doesn’t matter what beliefs or philosophy on life you hold, the practice will take you where you need to go.</p>

				    </div>
				  </dt>
				  <dd>
				
				              <p>There is now a list of scientifically proven benefits to be gained from regular Mindfulness practice that enhance brain function and promote overall health and wellbeing:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Clarity of thought</li>
												<li>Improves concentration</li>
												<li>Enhances creativity</li>
												<li>Heightens self-awareness</li>
												<li>Improves memory</li>
												<li>Increases emotional intelligence</li>
												<li>Improves mood</li>
												<li>Improves focus &amp; attention</li>
												<li>Increases compassion</li>
												<li>Relieves stress &amp; anxiety</li>
												<li>Relieves depression</li>
												<li>Promotes self-acceptance</li>
												<li>Lowers blood pressure</li>
												<li>Boosts immune system</li>
												<li>Improves emotional resilience</li>
												<li>Reduces pain</li>
												<li>Increases reaction speed</li>
												<li>Improves sleep</li>
											</ul>
											
				<p>Neuroscience studies have also proved that Mindfulness training can change the structure and function of our brains in as little as six weeks - increasing the thickness of the pre-frontal cortex region (areas responsible for attention &amp; emotion); changing the way our amygdala responds (area activated when we are stressed and fearful), and preventing age-related decline in cognitive functioning.</p>
				<p>So not only does Mindfulness help us feel more creative, connected, productive and energized, it also helps us cope better with the stresses and strains of modern living - total rejuvenation for body and mind.</p>

				              <div>
				        <p>Mindfulness helps us cope more skillfully with a whole range of life issues from relationship and family problems to work-related stress.  It is a very effective way of managing difficult thoughts, feelings and emotions, and can be particularly useful for dealing with distressing states such as OCD, addictions, anger, alcoholism, sleep problems, binge eating, panic attacks, anxiety and depression.<br>
				<br>
				So can Mindfulness really do all this stuff? Yes it can. It’s all about where you are at in your life right now - what you need - and how you choose to apply the practice in your daily life. Everyone’s experience is unique. You simply have to give it a go. </p>

				              <div>
				        <p>Mindfulness is a skill. And just like learning to paint, dance, or play a new instrument - our ability improves with training and practice. So for most people, a course with an experienced teacher is the best way to get started. A course can also provide a much-needed booster along the way, motivating us to keep going if the habit has lapsed, or helping us deepen our practice when the time is right. Mindfulness training gives us choice and mastery over our mind state, so we can learn to connect more reliably to our best self. And whilst some people are naturally more mindful than others, absolutely everyone can improve with regular training and practice.</p>

				              <div>
				        <p>Mindfulness is the practice of awareness. It is less of a technique, and more a way of being. We can develop the art of Mindfulness by training in meditation, since focusing on the breath and body helps anchor us to the present moment. However, with Mindfulness, we are not seeking to empty the mind of thought, but simply to be aware of what the mind actually does. Many every-day experiences can be used as the training object when developing Mindfulness e.g. walking, eating, brushing our teeth, or even standing in a bus queue!</p>

					              <div>
					        <p>It is important to remember that there is no right or wrong way to connect to Mindfulness practice. There are many different types of training and techniques, so you must find the path that’s right for you. This course is a pioneering approach to Mindfulness that takes it off the cushion and into the real world, challenging the conventional theory that you have to be sitting still or lying down to meditate. It is for anyone who wants to get the most out of life, regardless of circumstance or spiritual belief. You will learn to practice Mindfulness anytime and anywhere, without the need for any special devices, recordings, quiet space or a dedicated practice time (often between 30 – 40 minutes a day on other courses). The training framework is built around the classic definition of Mindfulness provided by the founder of modern Mindfulness Jon Kabat Zinn: ‘The awareness that arises out of paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment, non- judgmentally, ‘ and is based on 5 main principles of Mindfulness: PAUSE (slowing down), INTENTION, ATTENTION, INSIGHT (Understanding Me) and COMPASSION. It offers multiple entry points to Mindfulness, exploring the practice through neuroscience, the moving body and psychological theory. Although slightly shorter in length than many of the more traditional 8-week programs, the groundbreaking exercises and techniques allow for a deeper and more accelerated learning experience. </p>

					        <p>You will get the most benefit from the course if you attend all five sessions. However, if you are not able to attend all the dates, we will try to accommodate this. If you can do less than three sessions, and are likely to miss the first one, then it is possible that you will not get the most out of the training.

However, if you are currently going through a major life change such as a recent bereavement, this may not be quite the right training environment for you. In the event of exceptional life circumstances, our tutor may advise you to attend a parallel course more suited to your personal needs. Please do let us know if you have any questions or concerns, and we will put you in touch with our course tutor.</p>

					        <p>No, this is first and foremost a Mindfulness course. However, some simple meditative techniques (e.g. mindfulness of the breath, mindfulness of sounds, mindful eating and mindful walking) may be used throughout the training to help us connect easily to the present moment.</p>

					              <div>
					        <p>Yes. This is an alternative training approach that will revitalize your relationship to Mindfulness and meditation, complimenting any existing knowledge and techniques you may have. It is designed to fit in with your existing lifestyle, values and beliefs.</p>

					  </dt>

					              <div>
					        <p>No. This is not group therapy, self-help or cognitive therapy. Mindfulness is not a cure all or fashionable quick fix - it’s a way of being. You will of course develop a far deeper understanding of your own body and mind, which will help you to make positive and lasting changes in your life. <br>
					<br>
					Mindfulness is about process not content - understanding how minds work, and becoming more skilled at detecting our own subtle patterns of thinking and behaviour, rather than focusing on specific issues or problems. This course is not a substitute for professional medical help or counselling in any way, although it will certainly compliment any treatments you may be having. </p>

					The Art of Mindfulness is a not-for-profit venture. Any profits generated through the project (beyond the costs of putting on the course), will be reinvested for the development of further courses. Our intention is to make Mindfulness training accessible to all, by offering subsidized places for as many people as possible. </p>
